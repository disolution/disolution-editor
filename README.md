#### Easily create and manage DOCN projects

The idea starts off simple - to build a free and open-source multi-purpose offline and online git-based projects editor in javascript.
There's quite a lot of work ahead.

### Stack

* React, Redux + nodegit ... - all packaged as a standalone desktop app using Electron
* Easy offline DOCN git formatted project repository editing and online publishing if needed
* Manages all main project data in a project.json and also automatically generates a beatiful representation of it in README.md
* Allows to link DOCN project repos to other kinds of software repo's - maybe using .docn files that contain the public repository URL and a unique project keyword
