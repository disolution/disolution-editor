###### [prototype - work in progress]

#### The idea
All great projects have to start somewhere - but how do you develop your **ideas** and
find collaborators right now?
There have always been different ways, sure.

But how many people have the chance to learn from this process and maybe even help out?
Probably not *everyone..*

> *..unless*
> ### anyone could develop their ideas with tools like GIT and Github for open collaboration.

**Disolution** tends to be similar to [*Gitbook*](https://www.gitbook.com/) - although more simple, open-source and trying to promote the usage amongst anyone.
From developing personal ideas to easily publishing the projects of the future on
open collaborative sites like [Guaana.com](https://www.guaana.com).

Feel free to help out with the development and discussions.

### Stack
* React, Redux, Material-UI, nodegit, SimpleMDE markdown editor etc - packaged as a simple desktop app using Electron

#### Authoring projects
* Easy offline DOCN git formatted project repository editing and online publishing if needed
* Manages all main project data in a project.json and also automatically generates a beatiful representation of it in README.md
* Allows to link DOCN project repos to other software repo's - maybe using a .docn/project.json file containing the public repository URL. So you could add your higher-level explanation of a software project into another repository that can be read and understood better by non-technical people, for your own good!
* A timeline viewer that can be used to quickly get an overview what has changed over time

#### Collaboration
* Co-authoring ( managing and linking team members in the repo )
* Threads - discussion topics
* Integration with github issues, discourse forums. Pulling the most useful developing comments and ideas from external sources to the main project repo for credits.
* Possibility for well defined project dependencies (other DOCN projects)
* Linking threads to other threads in other projects

\* Check the disolution/project-docn repository for a more detailed explanation of the DOCN format and project.
